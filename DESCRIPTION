Title: Implement ROSETTA pedotransfer functions in R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Dewey Dunnington <dewey@fishandwhistle.net>
Maintainer: Dewey Dunnington <dewey@fishandwhistle.net>
Description: Implements pedotransfer functions for use in R that were originally
    implemented in ROSETTA software <https://cals.arizona.edu/research/rosetta/>,
    which is available for computers still running 32-bit Windows platforms.
    Pedotransfer functions are implemented in such a way as to ensure a native feel
    for use in R and provide an implementation for those without access to the legacy
    platform for which ROSETTA software is built.
